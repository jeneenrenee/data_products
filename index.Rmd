## How many vegetables should you plant in your garden?  

This Shiny app will calculate that for you based on:
 - How many people you plan to feed from your garden
 - What kind of vegetables you want to plant

---
## Why?

This is for a Coursera "Developing Data Products" project.  

---

## Where is the app?

The shiny app can be found at

https://jeneenrenee.shinyapps.io/project/

To estimate how much you need to plant:
 - Enter how many people will be fed from your garden
 - Click a box for each vegetable you'd like to plant
 - The results are displayed interactively in the main panel

## Resources and embedded r code

Numbers for the calculations are based on information from

- http://gardening.about.com/od/vegetable1/a/How-Much-Plant_2.htm

Example:  For 4 people who will eat asparagus:
```{r}
  vegetables <- c("asparagus","beets")
  numbers <- c(10, 3)
  type <- c("plants", "feet")
  amt <- as.numeric(numbers[1]) * 4
  z <- paste(vegetables[1], ":", amt, type[1], "\n")
  z
```
